# Motion Extraction Examples

These are inspired by a video made by Posy on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSS6yAMZF78). 

All recorded footage is shot on an iPhone 13 and all stock footage is from [Vecteezy](https://www.vecteezy.com/)

All editing is done on DaVinci Resolve 20.2 Free and the tutorial for doing it yourself on Premiere Pro and DaVinci Resolve is found [here](https://youtu.be/woj4vfMLpao?si=yWna0ZytX1JCj2jh)
